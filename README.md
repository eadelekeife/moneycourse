# moneycourse
Moneycourse is a financial mobile app where users can purchase airtime, data and cable TV subscriptions. Users can also transfer cash to other users on the 
Moneycourse platform with just the beneficiary's email address. There is also a savings option on the app. Users can transfer money in and withdraw whenever
they feel like.

Please note that Moneycourse is just a portfolio project that I built with ReactNative. Every function works like a normal app. Users can signup and can pay
for airtime, data and receive them on their mobile phones. The user transfer and savings also work but there is no license from any government agency. I 
will never steal your data or money and to be honest, I would not recommend that you put your savings on here. This is just an app I built to improve my 
app building skills
